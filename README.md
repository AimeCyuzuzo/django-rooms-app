# django-rooms-app
A site for creating public rooms and discuss about different topics. Built using django and sqlite3

Remember to run "python manage.py makemigrations", "python manage.py migrate" and "python manage.py createsuperuser".
I removed all of these to make sure that I deleted all my databases that I was using for testing in development mode.
I know the styling looks bad, I'll be working on it.
